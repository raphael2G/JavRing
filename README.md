# JavRing
A portable device which can be placed on the body of a javelin to deliver previously unavailable insights on the javelin's acceleration, velocity, and orientation. The idea is to collect data that is extremely important, but very difficult to measure through video / feel. I have so far only worked onteh functinality of collecting data, and that is mostly done! I do plan on finishing this at some point. 

Image of functionality (have not done UI yet)

Thought I would share some screenshots on what the app looks like as of now.
