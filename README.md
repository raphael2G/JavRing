8/2/2024 - Created Repo
This is a project I have thought about for a long time, and have been working on for a few months on and off. I finally got the Jav Ring functional, but the code is not organized nor well written due to a lack of ability. So, I am going to rewrite a lot of the project to improve upon current limitations. I am going to update this journal occasionally, and manage progress through github. Hopefully, progress will be made.
